Cooperating processes require an **Inter - process communication** (`IPC`) mechanism that will allow them to exchange data— that is, send data to and receive data from each other.
2 fundamental models of **inter-process** communication: **shared memory** and **message passing**.
**shared-memory model**,
					a region of memory that is shared by the cooperating processes is established. Processes can then exchange information by reading and writing data to the shared region.
**message-passing model**,
					communication takes place by means of messages exchanged between the cooperating processes.

**Message passing Model** 's:
`Cons`:
1. Message passing is useful for exchanging smaller amounts of data, because no conflicts need be avoided. 
2. Message passing is also easier to implement in a distributed system than shared memory.

`Pros`:
1.  Message-passing systems are typically implemented using **system calls** and thus require the **more time-consuming task** of **kernel** intervention.
2. 



**Shared Memory Model** 's:
`Cons`:
1. Shared memory can be faster than message passing, since message-passing systems are typically implemented using system calls and thus require the more time-consuming task of kernel intervention.
2. In shared-memory systems, system calls are required only to establish shared memory regions. Once shared memory is established, all accesses are treated as routine memory accesses, and no assistance from the kernel is required.
